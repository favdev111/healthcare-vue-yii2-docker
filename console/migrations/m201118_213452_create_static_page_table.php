YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis section applies only to California residents. Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;), below is a summary of the &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; categories, as identified and defined by the CCPA (see California Civil Code section 1798.140 (o)), that we collect, the reason we collect your Personal Information, where we obtain the Personal Information, and the third parties with whom we may share your Personal Information. We do not generally sell information as the term &ldquo;sell&rdquo; is traditionally understood. However, if and to the extent &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those implemented specifically for interest-based advertising, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe generally collect the following categories of Personal Information about your when you use our Site or services:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ndash; identifiers such as a name, address, unique personal identifier, email, phone number, your device&rsquo;s IP address, software, and identification numbers associated with your devices;<br />\r\n&ndash; protected classifications, such as gender;<br />\r\n&ndash; commercial information such as records of products or services purchased obtained, or considered by you;<br />\r\n&ndash; health information;<br />\r\n&ndash; Internet or other electronic information regarding you browsing history, search history, the webpage visited before you came to our Site, length of visit and number of page views, click-stream data, locale preferences, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, and system configuration information;<br />\r\n&ndash; your geolocation, to the extent you have configured your device to permit us to collect such information;<br />\r\n&ndash; audio recordings of your voice to the extent you call us, as permitted under applicable law;<br />\r\n&ndash; inferences about your preferences, characteristics, behavior, and attitudes;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more information about the Personal Information we collect and how we collect it, please refer to Sections 1 and 2, above.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe collect your Personal Information for the business purposes described in Section 3, above. The CCPA defines a &ldquo;business purpose&rdquo; as the use of Personal Information for the business&rsquo;s operational purposes, or other notified purposes provided the use of Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the operational purpose for which the Personal Information was collected or another operational purpose that is compatible with the context in which the Personal Information was collected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe categories of third parties with whom we may share your Personal Information are listed in Section 4, above.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrivacy Rights<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are a California resident, you have rights in relation to your Personal Information; however, your rights are subject to certain exceptions. For instance, we cannot disclose specific pieces of Personal Information if the disclosure would create a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of the Personal Information, your account with us or the security of our network systems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight Against Discrimination - You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights described in this section. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your right to know, delete or opt-out of sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight to Know - You have the right to request in writing: (i) a list of the categories of personal information, such as name, address, email address, that a business has disclosed to third parties during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties&#39; direct marketing purposes, and (ii) the names and addresses of all such third parties. In addition, you have the right to request: (i) the categories of personal information we have collected about you, (ii) the categories of sources from which personal information is collected, (iii) the business or commercial purpose for the information collection, (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we have shared personal information, and (v) the specific pieces of personal information we hold about an individual. You have the right to request a copy of the specific Personal Information we collected about you during the 12 months before your request.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight to Delete - You have the right to request us to delete any Personal Information we have collected from you or maintain about you, subject to certain exceptions.<br />\r\nTo assert your right to know or your right to delete your Personal Information, please contact according to the &ldquo;Contact Information&rdquo; section below. To verify your identity, we may ask you to verify Personal Information we already have on file for you. If we cannot verify your identity from the information we have on file, we may request additional information from you, which we will only use to verify your identity, and for security or fraud prevention purposes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight to Opt-Out of Selling. As described in this Privacy Policy, in certain situations we may share your Personal Information with our partners, third parties or affiliates for our marketing or other purposes. To the extent such sharing is considered a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under the CCPA, as a California resident, you have the right to opt-out of such sharing. If you would like us to no longer share your Personal Information in this way, please email privacy@winitclinic.com. If you opt-out, we may be unable to offer you some of our Services which require the sharing of Personal Information.<br />\r\nIn addition, California Civil Code Section &sect; 1798.83 permits users of our Site that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes (if applicable). To make such a request, please send an email or write to us (see Contact Information below).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n8.

All personal information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL or other encryption technology or will use our third-party payment processors, who will use appropriate security procedures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe safety and security of your information also depend on you.

To this effect, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do not reach such solution, then the Dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Austin, Texas, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), subject to the limitations of this section. This agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable under the prevailing law of any court having jurisdiction. Notice of a demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party hereto and with the AAA. To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under this Agreement must be filed within one year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the claim or notice of dispute first could be filed. If a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred. <br /><br />The parties agree that one (1) arbitrator shall arbitrate the Dispute. The arbitrator shall be selected by the joint agreement of the parties, but if they do not so agree within twenty (20) days after the date of the notice of a demand for arbitration referred to above, the selection shall be made pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA from the panels of business arbitrators maintained by the AAA. The decision of the arbitrator shall be made in writing, shall be final, judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the decision shall not be subject to vacation, modification or appeal, except to the extent permitted by sections 10 and 11 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of which sections the parties agree shall apply. Further, unless both you and we agree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The expenses of arbitration, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, shall be shared equally by the parties. <br /><br />Either party may bring a claim related to intellectual property rights, or seek temporary and preliminary specific performance and injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the posting of a bond or other security. <br /><br />DMCA Notification <br /><br />We respect the rights of intellectual property holders.
